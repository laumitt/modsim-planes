Question
- why is this question relevant to the system you are studying
  - airport delays suck
  - if we can find the best way to get air traffic to recover quickly we could make basically every holiday/vacation season easier for everyone
    ^ are we necessarily finding the best way to recover? or are we more just seeing how much time it takes
      in which case maybe more of just knowing how much your flight will be delayed
        ^ we can mess with breakage probability as a representation of routine maintenance but i agree it's more of giving accurate predictions for travelers
  - airport delays domino and one delay affects many flights after it, which can be infuriating for travelers on later flights who get their departure delayed
    and often have that time changed multiple times. we aim to model how quickly an air traffic system can recover from a delay, to give travelers more
    accurate predictions of their true departure time. we may extend our model to explore the fastest way to help an airport recover, in order to minimize
    the effects of one plane's delay on the rest of the system.

Model/Methodology
- document (explicit) assumptions and simplifications and explain why you made them
  - we assume planes are full and people will get on the right flight on their own
  - we also assume a smaller scaled system will accurately represent a larger one because we're modeling the 10 busiest US airports with real flight times
- tell us the parameters you are including and those you are excluding and why
  - including airports, flight times, breakage probability
  - excluding plane capacity, airport size (for now), people moving between planes

Results
- show your results alongside results from other studies or other comparable data

Interpretation
- discuss and contextualize your results
- discuss the limitations of your answer in terms of overall design, assumptions, data used, and sophistication of modeling methods

PLANE
- id number
- location
- destination
- next important time (takeoff or arrival)

AIRPORT
- code
- airport-specific schedule
  - departures
  - arrivals
- weather conditions (probability of storm)

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
- airport codes
- times between airports
- number of planes
- overall schedule

QUESTIONS/NOTES
- do planes know their personal schedule or are they told every time they're about to take off?
- who tells a plane it breaks?
- airports can have storms which delay all the planes at once - how?

ORDER OF EVENTS
- air traffic control makes an overall schedule with just departure time, origin, destination
- air traffic control distributes airport-specific schedules to each airport with only their departures and arrivals and times
- air traffic control decides when and where storms are, and for how long
- atc updates time + 1
- everything asks atc for current time
- each airport checks if they have a flight departing
  - if there's a departure they check if they have a plane ready to fly
    - if there's a plane ready to fly the airport tells it what its destination is and sends it out
      - the plane asks atc for its flight time
    - if there's not a plane ready to fly the flight is delayed + 1
- each plane checks if the current time is the same as its arrival time
  - if it should be arriving, it tells the destination airport it has arrived
- each airport checks if they have a flight arriving
  - if there's an arrival they receive the plane and clear its destination
- each airport checks if they have storm-related delays coming up
  - if (storm start time - storm length = current time) and there is a flight to a storm airport before (storm start time + storm length) it gets delayed + 1
  - if the airport is under a storm, all departing flights are pushed back + 1
- atc updates time + 1
- everything asks atc for current time
- repeat
